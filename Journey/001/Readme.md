## Day 1

This is **day 1** of my *100 days of cloud* journey.

I learnt about this challenege from Gwyneth's youtube challenge and found it interesting to go for. This is also a way to document what all I learnt in this journey. After completing AZ-104, I want to take some time and polish my practical skills in Azure as well as other cloud providers and this challenge looks like a nice way! 

Today I only created this repo and post about this challenge on my Linkedin.
Looking forward to start strong tomorrow!
