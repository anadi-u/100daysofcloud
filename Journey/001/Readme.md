# Day 1

This is **day 1** of my *100 days of cloud* journey.

I learnt about this challenege from Gwyneth's youtube challenge and found it interesting to go for. This is also a way to document what all I learnt in this journey. After completing AZ-104, I want to take some time and polish my practical skills in *Azure* as well as other cloud providers and this challenge looks like a nice way! 

## Goals I want to accomplish in this challenge:
- Getting hands-on experience in cloiud computing technologies like Azure,AWS and OCI
- Implementing proper documentation in GitHub
- Trying to follow a discplined way of learning about cloud regularly :sweat_smile:


Today I only created this repo and post about this challenge on my Linkedin.
Looking forward to start strong tomorrow!:muscle:
